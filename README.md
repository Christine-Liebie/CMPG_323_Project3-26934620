## Patterns and Standards
This project is meant to display the use of SOLID Design Principles in coding (mostly focusing on the first two principles).
SOLID is an acronym that stands for five key design principles: 
- single responsibility principle 
- open-closed principle 
- Liskov substitution principle
- interface segregation principle
- dependency inversion principle

### Web App
A simple CRUD Web App is used to test the implementation, and the following steps can help you use it:


When the app is launched, it opens up at Home. You can choose to register or log in. 
![Home](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/99386016/192980289-149d99e4-3f35-44e1-b8bb-6fa6481ca546.png)


Register first before trying to log in, if it is your first time using the app. 
Make sure your Email and Password is in the right format:
- Email should end with *@gmail.com
- Password should atleast be 7 characters long, contain atleast 1 lower-case and upper-case letter, contain numbers and a symbol

Make sure your Email and Password is correct, and is the same as you used to register.

From this overall view, you can select Zones, Categories or Devices. All three works the same, so only Zones will be used as an example.
